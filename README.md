# Morning Agent

This project uses Google's Agent Development Kit to create a multitool AI Agent.

Currently able to give random trivia facts and retrieve news using new_api.

Working towards functionality to become a versatile morning assistant, giving events, news, maybe weather.

This is mostly a testing ground to become comfortable with using AI agents.

## Other things to try
- Add some session information (what do i need to remember tho)
- Add safety tools
- Access Google Calendar
